# catty
it cat but it mine

just an implementation cat for practice. if for some reason you want to use this, you really should be asking yourself, "why?".
I wouldn't use it. cat has been used and abused and stands up the test of time. it's maybe even thread safe and shit.
this implementation is literally for practice. don't use it, just use cat instead oh god
